# GR5293-Final-Project

In our project, we are interested in seeing whether the implementation of DST could, in fact, affect the number of car accidents and the consumptions of electricity within the relative time period in the U.S.
In particular, we will compare car accident and electricity consumption data of three states, including Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, for the starting and ending periods of DST.
