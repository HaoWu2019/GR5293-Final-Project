# GR5293-Final-Project

Daylight Saving Time (DST), or daylight time (U.S) and summer time (U.K), was invented by New Zealand astronomer George Hudson in 1895. By adjusting clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the fall to standard time, DST has made significant impacts of our daily lives in various areas.

In our project, we are interested in seeing whether the implementation of DST could, in fact, affect the number of car accidents and the consumptions of electricity within the relative time period in the U.S.

In particular, we will compare car accident and electricity consumption data of three states, including Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, for the starting and ending periods of DST.
